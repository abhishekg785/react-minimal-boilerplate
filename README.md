# React boilerplate

Simple react boilerplate, nothing fancy ( I have created so many now  :p )

Clone it and get started with it. It can be improved a lot, but serves a basic purpose.

# Commands

Run the webpack server : 
``` 
    yarn run start 
```

Build the files for production: 
``` 
    yarn run build
```

In production, it will also generate ``` report.html ``` and ``` stats.json``` files using ``` webpack bundle analyzer ```,
which can be used to analyze the use of node modules in the project.

It also produces the file ```records.json```, can be used to track how modules change b/w builds, application in code splitting.

# Notes

Project use eslint, also extends ```airbnb``` eslint config.

Project uses ```flow``` for static type checking. ( I like flow, but i will still prefer typescript )

and uses other basic stuff like webpack, babel etc. explore !

Let me know if any good changes are needed!
